                    The true evolutionary lineage of code is often complex, subjective, and ambiguous. As such, existing techniques are predisposed to, both, overestimate and underestimate true evolution lineage. This new technique addresses these issues by providing a more expressive model of code evolution — the fuzzy history graph — and a novel multi-revision code-history analysis — fuzzy history slicing — by representing code lineage as a continuous (i.e., fuzzy) metric rather than a discrete (i.e., absolute) one.  We found that fuzzy history slicing provides a tunable balance of precision and recall, an overall improved accuracy over existing code-evolution models, and improved accuracy for code-history analysis tasks.</p>

                    A good understanding of the practices followed by software development projects can positively impact their success — particularly for attracting talent and on-boarding new members. In this paper, we perform a cluster analysis to classify software projects that follow continuous integration in terms of their activity, popularity, size, testing, and stability. Based on this analysis, we identify and discuss four different groups of repositories that have distinct characteristics that separates them from the other groups. With this new understanding, we encourage open source projects to acknowledge and advertise their preferences according to these defining characteristics, so that they can recruit developers who share similar values.</p>

                <p><img style="float: right;" src="img/bugInvestigation.jpg">
                    In this paper, I propose a line of research that is based on an automated technique to support bug investigation by using a novel analysis of the history of the source code. During the bug-fixing process, developers spend a high amount of manual effort investigating the bug in order to answer a series of questions about it. This line of research pursues to support developers in answering the following questions about a bug: Who is the most suitable developer to fix the bug?, Where is the bug located?, When was the bug inserted? and Why was the bug inserted?</p>

                <p><img style="float: right;" src="img/HistorySlicingFSE.jpg">
                    In this paper, we present Chronos, a tool that enables the querying, exploration, and discovery of historical change events to source code. Unlike traditional Revision-Control-System tools, Chronos allows queries across any subset of the code, down to the line-level, which can potentially be contiguous or disparate, even among multiple files. In addition, Chronos provides change history across all historical versions (i.e. it is not limited to a pairwise &ldquo;diff&rdquo;). Chronos supports pattern recognition and discovery, and a low-level view that supports semantic comprehension for tasks such as reverse engineering and identifying design rationale.</p>

                    In this paper, we present an approach called history slicing that can automatically identify a minimal number of code modifications, across any number of revisions, for any arbitrary segment of source code at fine granularity. Many software-engineering tasks require developers to understand the history and evolution of source code.
                    We also present our implementation of history slicing, Chronos, that includes a novel visualization of the entire evolution for the code of interest. Finally, we provide two experiments that show that history slicing offered drastic improvements over the conventional techniques in three ways: (1) the amount of information needed to be examined and traced by developers was reduced by up to three orders of magnitude; (2) the correctness of developers attempting to solve software-maintenance tasks was more than doubled; and (3) the time to completion of these software-maintenance tasks was almost halved.</p>

                    Our results show that 81% of the time, WhoseFault produced the same developer that actually fixed the fault within the top three suggestions. We also show that our technique improved by a difference between 4% and 40% the results of a baseline technique. Finally, we explore the influence of each of the three components of our technique over its results.This paper describes a new technique, which automatically selects the most appropriate developers for fixing the fault represented by a failing test case, and provides a diagnosis of where to look for the fault. To our knowledge, this technique is the first to assign developers to execution failures, without the need for textual bug reports.</p>

                    Multiple software engineering tasks, such as program understanding or assessment of developer expertise, benefit from using the history of source code. However, determining the evolution of a set of lines of code is a manual and time consuming process. This paper presents a model of this process and an approach for automating it. We also present some preliminary results which show initial evidence that our automated technique can be several orders of magnitude faster than a manual approach and require that developers examine up to two orders of magnitude less code in extracting such histories.</p>

Proceedings of the Workshop on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE 2010), Cape Town, South Africa, May 2010, pp. 39&ndash;46.</em></p>

                <p><img style="float: right;" src="img/CASI.jpg">
                    Indirect conflicts are produced when multiple developers perform changes in parallel to source code entities that depend on each other. CASI informs developers in real time of the changes that are taking place in a software project and the source code entities influenced by them. It visualizes this influence together with directionality and severity information to help developers decide whether a concrete situation represents an indirect conflict.</p>

                <p><img style="float: right;" src="img/Lighthouse.jpg">
                    Despite the fact that software development is an inherently collaborative activity, a great deal of software development is spent with developers in isolation, working on their own parts of the system. In these situations developers are unaware of parallel changes being made by others, often resulting in conflicts. One approach to deal with this issue is called conflict resolution, which means that changes have been checked-in and developers must use tools to resolve conflicts and retest the code to ensure its correctness. Unfortunately, this process becomes more difficult the longer the conflicts go undetected. To address these issues, we are proposing a conflict avoidance approach that helps to find conflicts as soon as they occur. Lighthouse is an Eclipse plug-in that brings this approach to developers by utilizing a concept called emerging design, an up to date design representation of the code, alerting developers of potentially conflicting implementation changes as they occur.</p>
