        <h3>   Bloomberg Interview <small>Sep 13, 2017</small>  </h3>

        <p>
            After the CSRC Career Fair, I got an interview from Bloomberg on campus.
        </p>
        <ul>I prepared a lot in the 2 days.
            <li>Review Java basic</li>
            <li>Review Design Pattern</li>
            <li>Review OO Design</li>
            <li>Review Algorithms and Data structures</li>
            <li>Review my projects</li>
            <li>Watch Bloombergs' website to answer <quate>Why Bloomberg?</quate></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In the interview, it was not as serious as I thought. After quickly pass my resume, they started asking Algorithms and Data structures.
            And, only Algo and Data Structs
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            First one: <br/>
            Given an array, front part is ascend and sorted, when some point it turns descend and sorted. Given target, find the target's index in the array.
            Require: smaller than O(n). e.g: [1,2,8,7,6,5,4,3], find 4<br/>
            The first thought I came up is binary search. But it's not very clear how to binary.  <b>Struggling for a while</b>, the interviewer gave me some hints.
        </p>
        <ul> Three steps
            <li>Binary for the <em>changing point</em></li>
<pre><code>
    int low = 0, high = arr.length-1 , mid = (low+high)/2 ;
    while(low < high)
    {
        if(arr[mid-1] < arr[mid] && arr[mid] < arr[mid+1]) // left
            low = mid+1;
        if(arr[mid-1] > arr[mid] && arr[mid] > arr[mid+1]) // right
            high = mid-1;
        if(arr[mid]>arr[mid-1] && arr[mid]>arr[mid+1])
            return mid;  // index of the biggest element
        mid = (low+high)/2;
    }

</code></pre>
            <li>Binary for the ascent part</li>
            <li>Binary for the descent part</li>
        </ul>

        <hr/>
        <p>
            Second one: <br/>
            Design a datastructure to implement this: <em>A speciall lottery, let's say [A,B,C,D,E] is playing it. Every round pick a random number, suppose is 4. Then A,B,C,D, eliminate D (now[A,B,C,E]). Next round, suppose 3, then E,A,B, eliminate B(now[A,C,E]. Play this until only one left</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            I came up the solution very fast, <b>Circled Linked List</b>
        </p>


        <hr/>
        <p>
            After one week, I am rejected by Bloomberg. I think the reason is I didn't do very quickly on the first question. But what I did nicely
            was I wrote down my thinking clue as comments, and explained it to the recruiter. The code I wrote on the paper is well commented
            and the style is faily nice. So the only reason I believe is the interviewees are better than me. Because that night of Microsoft Coding
            Competition, the second price team's girl also went to Bloomberg's interview. Maybe that's why I am rejected
        </p>
        <p>
            After this rejection, I think I need to be damn good at Algorithms and Datastructure. That is the key point of getting a intern or a
            job. Whether you get the offer, not because how you perform in the interview, the place you are in all the candidates matters.
            So finally, try to do more algorithms. Hope next time interview, I can be better.
        </p>
