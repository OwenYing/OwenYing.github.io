        <h3>   Career Fair <small>Sep 11, 2017</small>  </h3>

        <p>
            This is the first time that I attend a career fair. A little bit excited and nervous too.
            I am looking for 2018 summer's internship.
            I made a list of companies that I must apply to. These are
            <em>Facebook, Amazon, Bloomberg, Microsoft, Visa, IBM ...</em>. Lots of small companies
            cannot sponsor international students. So international students' choice is not wide.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the companies collect my resume and still need to apply online.
            Firstly, I am a little nervous so I choose some small companies to start with as <em>Walmart Tech and etc.</em>
            After talking to some recruiters, I am feeling prepared.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first company I go to is Facebook. They collect your e-resume and it's done. Most of the
            companies do this, and ask about your resume.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most different company is Bloomberg. They quickly review your resume and then ask
            you algorithms. My question is <b>find missing elements in sorted array</b>.
            eg: [1,2,5,8], then you need to return [3,4,6,7]
            <br/>
            I done it by
            <ul>
                <li>Make an example</li>
                <li>Write down my steps of the algo as comments</li>
                <li>Name the variable nicely</li>
                <li>Solve the problem</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            After the day, I applied 10+ companies and gets lots of souvenirs, Yeah!! <br/>
            And I got an interview from Bloomberg.
        </p>
